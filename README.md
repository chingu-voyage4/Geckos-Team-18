# Geckos-Team-18
Geckos Team 18's took on the task of building a chat application for Voyage 4. 

The project was initially inspired by the [How to build your own real-time chat app](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/building-a-chat-application-with-mean-stack-637254d1136d) article. After team discussion it was decided that we would set out to build an application with similar functionality, but using a different design and tech stack.
